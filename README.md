# Hi, I'm Fawwaz Khan 👋

**BTech CSE (AI & ML) Student | Aspiring Product Manager | AI/ML Engineer**

Building products that solve real problems, one feature at a time.

## About Me

I'm a product-focused engineer who believes in building simple, effective solutions over complex systems. Currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science with a specialization in AI & ML at Jain (Deemed-to-be University), I blend technical depth with product thinking to create meaningful user experiences.

My approach: understand the problem first, validate the solution, then build the MVP. I enjoy working across the entire product lifecycle—from discovery to deployment.
